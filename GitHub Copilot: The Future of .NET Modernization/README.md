## Abstract
Dreading your next .NET upgrade? GitHub Copilot might just change that. In this session, I’ll share my experience working with Microsoft to test the new Copilot app modernization tools in Visual Studio and show how they can simplify upgrades and streamline modernization. With live demos on real codebases, you’ll see firsthand how Copilot makes the future of .NET modernization faster—and a lot less painful.
